With data mining and data analytics being very interrelated, much of the CRISP-DM model can be applied to analytics.  CRISP-DM breaks the data mining process into phases with the first phase focusing on business understanding and proper planning based on that understanding.  We can separate the business understanding phase into four parts: determining business objectives, assessing the situation, determining goals, and creating a plan."

In addition to resource constraints due to time or cost, it's important to determine any legal or security-related constraints. Once limitations and constraints are known, a list of risks that could delay the project can be compiled.  Methods to mitigate risk and contingency plans should also be developed.\n",

    "It is often convenient to store data in a database rather than in individual files.  There are a [variety of Python libraries available](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces) to interact with databases.  One of the most common is [SQLAlchemy](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/index.html) and pandas includes functionality to work with it.  Before we can use SQLAlchemy, we should make sure it is installed using `pip`.  Typically, we will install the libraries we expect to use before starting work in a notebook but for completeness, this step is included in this notebook."

The process we'll use to connect to and load data from the SQLite database can be used with other database engines such as Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL.\n",
    "\n",

A common way to access an API is by making [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) requests of a server in much the same way a web browser would. If the request is valid, the server hosting the API will respond with the requested data.  The response is often [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) text. \n",

To make an HTTP request, we'll use the popular [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.  In addition to providing the ability to make HTTP requests, the Requests library also includes functionality to convert JSON data into Python objects like lists and dictionaries.

    "Having a catalog of the data will help us determine if what we have is sufficient to continue with the project or if we'll need to gather more data.  For example, if we had been asked to determine if factors such as debt-to-income ratio or an internal-assigned grade was reliable in determining whether a loan would be paid off or not, it would appear that we have enough data to proceed based on our initial description of the data.  If, however, we were asked to give different weights to different types of existing debt (credit card balances versus home mortgages, for example), we would have to request additional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we have sufficient data, our next step might be to further explore our data characterize it and determine if any relationships exist. Before exploring data, however, the data must be transformed or cleaned to facilitate analysis.  Often, data cleansing and exploration are interwoven tasks.\n",
