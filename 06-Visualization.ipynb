    "For this unit, the notebook itself will not contain lab questions.  Instead, we'll create visualizations in [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) in the second part of the unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've examined and explored data, we often used visualizations to help make sense of things.  While the visualizations we've created have been sufficient for exploration, creating visualizations for reporting or to convey a story requires more attention to design and other details.  In this unit, we'll look at some design principles and the appropriate chart types for the given data. As an example, consider the charts in the figure below.  The bottom chart is more visually appealing than the top chart.  In this unit, we'll explore some of the reasons why this is the case.\n",

    "When looking at examples of types of visualizations, we'll create them with both [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)/[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).  Tableau is a popular data visualization product that provides an interface to many file and database sources and a simple-to-use but feature-rich interface.  A version of Tableau can be downloaded from [here](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download?signin=academic) but will require a license to use.\n",

    "Effective visualizations communicate their intent clearly and quickly.  If viewers have to spend a great deal of time deciphering a visualizations, they might as well be presented with the underlying data.  There are a variety of aspects and principles that can be considered when trying to create an effective visualization.  One of these is to consider the intended audience. We might choose to create a more technically-focused visualization or one with a deeper level detail if we expect that the viewer is familiar with the data or the context in which it exists as opposed to someone without any prior experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another principle principle might be to keep the visualization as simple as possible.  Though there might be a lot of data available for visualization, simpler visualizations are easier to understand and are less likely to be misunderstood that visualizations with many elements.  If there is a need to visualize a lot of data, consider creating separate visualizations for groups of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional principles we might consider when creating a visualization involve the perception of graphical elements in relation to one another and how color can be used effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perception\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering perception of graphical elements, we can rely on the Gestalt psychology [principles of grouping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping).  Among the principles, those that are of particular interest are\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proximity\n",
    "- Similarity\n",
    "- Enclosure\n",
    "- Closure\n",
    "- Continuity\n",
    "- Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proximity\n",
    "\n",
    "Proximity refers to the the nearness or distance between objects.  In visualizations, nearness can be used to imply a relationship or connectedness between graphical elements. Similarly, distance between elements implies that they are unrelated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the following image.  On the left, the spacing between each column is used the same and we likely perceive the dots as being part of a single collection.  On the right, the spacing is such that we see three sets of dots.  This notion of proximity is what allows us to understand that bars of differing length but equal width and spacing are used to present related data in bar charts (as we'll see later).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-proximity.png\" alt=\"demonstration of proximity\" >\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">Principle of Proximity, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gestalt_proximity.svg#/media/File:Gestalt_proximity.svg\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of similarity states that objects that share attributes are perceived as being part of a group and object with different attributes are not part of that group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following image, the shading of each row of dots conveys the existence of multiple groups.  The first and second rows are perceived as belonging to different groups.  We can make use of similarity to present similar data on the same plot. For example, we can plot lines representing different (but related) things using different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-similarity.png\" alt=\"demonstration of similarity\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">Principle of Similarity, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gestalt_similarity.svg#/media/File:Gestalt_similarity.svg\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "Enclosure refers to the idea that objects with a shared boundary, whether a line or an area with a common shading, are perceived as being part of the same group. Though this principle is not often used in visualizations it can be very good at achieving its purpose.  For example, in the image below, we perceive that the dots are placed in two main groups with each group being defined by a border line.  Notice that the principle of enclosure is more powerful than similarity (imposed by the color of each dot ) and proximity (imposed by the difference in horizontal spacing between dots).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-enclosure.png\" alt=\"demonstration of enclosure\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">Principle of Enclosure</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Closure\n",
    "\n",
    "Closure refers to our ability or tendency to complete patterns when part of the information is missing.  This tendency is strongest for simpler shapes as demonstrated by the following image where we naturally see a circle and rectangle rather than a collection of unrelated line segments.  This is useful in visualizations when we wish to establish a trend or have the viewer draw conclusions despite missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-closure.png\" alt=\"demonstration of closure\">\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of continuity states that objects that are aligned or appear to be continuous will be perceived as such. This is demonstrated in the figure below.  Despite the fact that there are actually two separate, orange line segments, we perceive them as being part of a longer segment.  Plotting different lines on one chart makes use of this principle allowing us to understand that even if lines intersect, each line continues after the intersection, i.e. the lines represent the same group of data before and after the intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-continuity.png\" alt=\"demonstration of continuity\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">Principle of Continuity</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection is more straightforward than some of the other principles.  It implies that if elements are connected by other elements, such as lines, we will perceive a grouping based on the connection. This is demonstrated in the figure below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-connection.png\" alt=\"demonstration of connection\">\n",

    "### Choosing a Palette\n",
    "\n",
    "Color plays in an important part in the visualizations we create.  Color can be use to distinguish between elements, to set one element apart from other, to indicate value, or even to convey a certain mood within a visualization.  At best, ignoring color choices can result in visualizations that are difficult to understand; at worst, it can result in something that viewers find jarring.  To choose the appropriate palette, we'll rely on [color theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's important to be aware of color theory, many visualization software packages will attempt to make the appropriate color choices for the data we're plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Color Wheel\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing color and how individual colors relate to one another, we often begin by looking at the color wheel. While there are different color wheels depending on whether we are looking at [mixing light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color) or [mixing pigments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color) and what we define as the primary colors, we will use the historical [Red-Yellow-Blue (RYB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RYB_color_model) for our discussion.  In this model, we assume that there are three *primary* colors from which most other colors can be derived through mixing; these colors are red, yellow, and blue.  Combining any two of these colors gives us the *secondary* colors (orange, green, and purple.  Combining a primary with one of its associated secondary colors gives us a *tertiary* color.  See the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-colorwheel.jpg\" alt=\"RYB color wheel\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">The RYB Color Wheel, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RBYcolourwheel.jpg#/media/File:RBYcolourwheel.jpg\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hue, Tint, and Shade\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the the notion of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, it's also important to be aware of hue, tint, shade, and tone.  A *hue* is \"pure\" color as it exists on the color wheel.  Adding white pigment to a hue results in a *tint*.  A *shade* of a color is the result of mixing the hue with black pigment.  A *tone* is mixing some amount of white and black pigment (gray) with the hue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-huetintshade.png\" alt=\"hue, tint, tone, and shade\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">Hue, Tint, Tone, and Shade, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tint-tone-shade.svg#/media/File:Tint-tone-shade.svg\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Monochromatic Color Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of palette we'll consider is one based on a monochromatic color scheme.  In this scheme, we first select a hue and then choose shades, tones, and tints based on this hue.  A monochromatic color scheme is often used for sequential, discrete data.  We can use a monochromatic scheme with continuous data where we slowly move from a shade to a tint.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-monochromatic.png\" alt=\"Monochromatic Palette\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">A Monochromatic Palette, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analogous Color Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "An analogous color scheme is chosen by first selecting a main color.  Next, we select the two adjacent colors.  If necessary or desired, we an select the next two adjacent colors as well.  With these colors, we choose tints and shades.  The analogous color scheme is often used with sequential data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-analogous.png\" alt=\"Analogous Palette\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">An Analogous Palette, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complementary Color Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "A complementary color scheme makes use of colors directly opposite one another on the color wheel.  This choice offers the greatest amount of contrast between colors.  While we could use the hues of both colors, this can be too striking; instead, we should choose one color as the predominant color and use tints and shades of the other color.  A complementary scheme is a good choice when emphasizing extreme values or when we wish to visualize divergent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-complementary.png\" alt=\"Complementary Palette\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">A Complementary Palette, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more \"nuanced\" palette, one could use a *split complementary* scheme in which two complementary colors are paired with adjacent colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-split.png\" alt=\"Split Complementary Palette\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">A Split Complementary Palette, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Triadic Color Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the complementary color scheme, a triadic color scheme is chosen by selecting three colors on the color wheel with an equal angle between pairs of colors.  Often, a main hue is chosen and tints and shades of the other colors are used. A triadic color scheme is often useful when working with qualitative or categorical data.  This idea can be extended for four, five, six, etc. colors.  It is important to avoid choosing similar tints and shades for different visual elements as this can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/06-triadic.png\" alt=\"Triadic Palette\">\n",
    "      <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">A Triadic Palette, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design\">source</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warm and Cool Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "As indicated earlier, colors can be used to convey a mood or emotion.  Warm colors - red, yellow, and orange - are often used to convey a sense of passion, happiness, enthusiasm, or energy.  Cool colors - green, blue, and purple - are used to convey a sense of calm or relaxation.  Neutral colors - black, white, gray, cream, and brown - are often used as backgrounds or for supporting information; these colors are affected by the colors that surround them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With these design and color principles, we can see some reasons why the first chart in the first figure is less visually appealing than the second chart.  The principle of proximity is not correctly applied; spacing should be added to set the years apart. The colors chosen do not effectively distinguish between the four regions; four distinct colors/hues should be chosen."
