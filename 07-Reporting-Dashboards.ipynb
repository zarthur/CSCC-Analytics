In this unit, we'll examine two means of doing this: creating report file containing the information that can be distributed and creating dashboards that can be used to quickly convey information using visual elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "While reports are often used to present summary information with supporting details in the form of a narrative, there is often a need for access to more-frequently-updated summary information.  One way of delivering this information is through the use of dashboards.  Dashboards are typically presented through a website or some other interactive medium that allows users to quickly and easily determine the state of [performance indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator). \n",

For this example, we'll work with the [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) load data available at [./data/01-loan.csv](./data/01-loan.csv).  The first dashboard we create will allow users to view loan amount and status by state.\n",

To create this visualization, we'll use `Addr State` as data for *Marks* that are used for \"detail\".  We can use `Loan Amnt` as *Marks* data as well but used to indicate \"color\". Tableau should automatically display a map with each state shaded with a different color depending on the amount of loans issued for that state.  To simplify the map, we'll exclude Alaska and Hawaii; to do this, drag `Addr State` to the *Filters* shelf and uncheck `Ak`and `Hi`. Double-click the title and change it to \"Amount by State\". We should now have a visualization similar to the one in the following image.\n",

To create this chart, we first change the data type of `Issue D` to \"Date & Time\" and use it for column values.  Row values will be based on the sum of `Loan Amnt`; we can create a filter to allow only non-null values of `Loan Amnt`.  To create a stacked bar chart, first change the marks to \"Bar\" and drag `Loan Status` to *Marks*; select the \"Color\" option for `Loan Status`. Chane the title to \"Loan Amount\".

Among the data are daily error rate and number of 90-day complaints per employee. It might be a departmental goal to reduce these numbers or keep aggregates below some threshold.  We can create a dashboard that provides this information to management with the ability to filter by employee.  \n",

    "To start, open the dataset in Tableau.  On the first worksheet, we'll create a [bullet graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_graph) for average daily error rate.  A bullet graph is a variation of a bar graph but provides additional such as a desired target and shading or coloring based on percentages of the target.  Bullet graphs are alternatives to classic gauges and meters. In addition to a field with data representing the measured value, we need data for target information.  If we were working with sales data, we might have actual monthly sales and budgets monthly sales where the budgeted values represent targets.  In this data, we don't have an existing field that represents our target; to create one, right-click in the area where fields are displayed and select \"Create Parameter\".  Let's name the new parameter \"Target Average Daily Error Rate\" and assign it a value of \"1\".  Drag both `Daily Error Rate` and `Target Average Daily Error Rate` to the *Rows* shelf; set the aggregation function for `Daily Error Rate` to average. From the *Show Me* menu, select \"bullet graph\". If the target field appear in the *Rows* shelf, right click on the values along the vertical axis and click \"Swap Reference Line Fields\".  We might want to only count current employees in the calculation; drag `Employment Status` to the *Filters* shelf and select \"Active\". Notice that the area from 0 to 60% of the target has a dark gray background, the area between 60% and 80% has a mid-gray background, and the area greater than 80% of the target has a light gray background.  To change this coloring, right-click on the values again and select \"Edit Reference Line\" and \"60%, 80% of ...\".  There are a variety of options here but we'll choose \"Stoplight\" for the fill color and check \"Reverse\".  Change the title to \"Daily Error\".
