With data mining and data analytics being very interrelated, much of the CRISP-DM model can be applied to analytics.  CRISP-DM breaks the data mining process into phases with the first phase focusing on business understanding and proper planning based on that understanding.  We can separate the business understanding phase into four parts: determining business objectives, assessing the situation, determining goals, and creating a plan."

    "Having a catalog of the data will help us determine if what we have is sufficient to continue with the project or if we'll need to gather more data.  For example, if we had been asked to determine if factors such as debt-to-income ratio or an internal-assigned grade was reliable in determining whether a loan would be paid off or not, it would appear that we have enough data to proceed based on our initial description of the data.  If, however, we were asked to give different weights to different types of existing debt (credit card balances versus home mortgages, for example), we would have to request additional data.\n",

Generally, sites restrict the use of scrapers; [scraping.pro](http://testing-ground.scraping.pro/) provides a set of pages to test web scrapers.  After loading and displaying the data notice that there are issues with the DataFrame including `NaN` values and formatting issues.  We will address some of these issues in later units.\n",

Use the [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) to retrieve weather data for Columbus on January 1, 2018 using the URL `https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2383660/2018/1/1` with panda's *read_json()* function; here `2383660` is the [WOEID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOEID) for Columbus. Use the API documentation to write up a description of the columns in the resulting DataFrame.  To write text in a cell, select *Cell*, *Cell Type*, and *Markdown* from the menus above.  Do not worry about formatting the description text."
