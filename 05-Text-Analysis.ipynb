    "A company is often interested in determining the public's opinion of the company's products and services.  Traditionally, this data might have been obtained through the use of customer satisfaction surveys or broader market research efforts.  With the growth in use of online shopping there are large collections of user reviews attesting to the quality of a company's offerings.  Similarly, the popular social media platforms allow users to easily share opinions in a public forum.  Collecting and analyzing this data can provide useful information that could be used to guide a company's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, we worked primarily with *structured data* - data with a well-defined organizational structure that adhered to certain properties which we could easily infer through exploration.  For example, the when we worked with county auditor data, each dataset was tabular with rows that represented an individual parcel and columns represented different properties of those parcels.  Each column had a specific data type and it was unlikely that a column value for a specific row would violate that type property. Structured data could be stored in a relational database (making use of the structured imposed by such a data store) and easily searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text in the form of user reviews or social media posts are often classified as *unstructured data* - data lacking a pre-defined organizational model where the characteristics of one record could differ significantly from another.  For example, in a collection of user reviews, one record might be \"This is a great product. I've owned it for five years and it always works perfectly!\".  Characteristics of this data could be that it is 84 characters long, written in English, and uses only [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters and we might write code that relies on those assumptions.  However, among the many reviews might be this review, \"Buen equipo, robusto, rápido, ... Perfecto para el uso que se le va a dar. Tiene de todo. Diseño moderno.\" This review is clearly not written in English and uses non-ASCII characters so any analysis that assumed these features might fail. We'll discuss collecting, processing, and analyzing unstructured data, focusing on text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As computing power and algorithms improve, it has become increasingly easy to extract information from unstructured data.  With this ability, it is important to be aware that there are potential ethical and legal issues.  As users freely post their thought on social media, is it ethically right to mine this data in attempt to increase profit or for other gain? While an exploration of legal issues is outside the scope of the material covered here, it is important that one is aware that such issues could exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "To work with text data, we'll make use of the following libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - a web scraping library\n",
    "- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - the Natural Language Toolkit, a library for processing language data\n",
    "- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - library for making HTTP requests and processing the results\n",
    "- [requests-oauthlib](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib) - [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) support for the requests library \n",
    "- [tinydb](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a document data store implemented in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use `pip` to install these libraries. We've worked with some of these before but we can ensure they are installed using `pip`."

    "A lot of human-generated text data in the form of reviews or social media posts are accessible on a web site. One way of accessing this data is through a process knowing as [*web scraping*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping).  Web pages are creating using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), a markup language that provides a way of indicating structure for the accompanying content.  We can make use of this structure as a way of identifying the location of text on a website that is of interest to us.  Modern websites make heavy use of JavaScript and CSS for interactive functionality and to tailor their appearance; while these are nice when we, as humans, are browsing a site, they don't usually impart structural changes to the underlying data so we'll only focus on HTML content for scraping.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a relatively simple example.  Consider this web page that was generated using Amazon product review data available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products/data).  This page is stored locally with our other data; to load data from a web server, we could use a library like [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, website owners typically discourage the use of scraping for collection of data; in fact, many prohibit the practice in their terms of service.  The data is, however, often made available via an [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) or API.  An API provides us with the means of systematically accessing data from a website or other Internet data store.  An overview of what an API is as well as a directory of available APIs is avilable at [Programmable Web].  For our work, we'll use the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs), specifically the [search] functionality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter requires users to authenticate their API request. To do this, we can follow the [instructions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started#get-started-app) provided by Twitter. we must first register an application with Twitter.  We begin by going to the [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com) page and signing in.  If you don't have a Twitter account, you will have to create one and provide a mobile phone number in order to create an app. Once logged in, we can create a new app.  When creating a new app, we have to provide some details including the application name, description, and a website; we also have to accept the [developer agreement](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement-and-policy).  See the following image for an example of the details provided for a new application.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/05-twitter.png\" alt=\"twitter app details\">\n",
    "    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\">Twitter App Details</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the application is created, the application details page will be displayed.  Near the top of the page is a collection of tabs including *Keys and Access Tokens* and *Permission*.  We'll use the *Keys and Access Tokens* page in a moment but for now, let's change the access premissions for this application.  Click *Permission*, choose *Read only* and update the settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, to access data on a website we have to log in with a username or email address and a password to verify our identity and that we are allowed to access certain content.  In the same way, we have to prove our identity when using many APIs.  Twitter makes use of a standard known as [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) to support access to its API.  We'll need the following pieces of data from the Twitter App page in order to access the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consumer Key\n",
    "- Consumer Secret\n",
    "- Access Token\n",
    "- Access Token Secret\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer key and consumer secret are on the Twitter App's *Keys and Access Tokens* page - navigate to the page.  We'll need to generate an access token and can do so from the same page.  After generating the token, we can store the necessary data in variables within the notebook. Replace the empty strings below with strings containing the appropriate data.  Be careful when sharing this data."

    "\n",
    "When working with unstructured data, we often have a need to aggregate and store it.  Historically, relational database management systems have been used to store structured data and SQL has been used to interface with these systems.  As the need to store unstructured data increased and traditional databases became less practical as storage solutions, [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) databases began to be developed.  There are a variety of types of NoSQL databases, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.  One of these types is a [document store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) where a *document* is associated with a key and stored in some sort of collection.  Here, a *document* is usualy some semi-structured data such as JSON or XML data.  Many document stores make use of the semi-structured nature of the documents to provided additional functionality such as querying for data within a document.  There are many document store implementations (and many more NoSQL database implementations in general).  As an example of working with a document store, we'll make use of [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a document store implemented entirely in Python.  As part of this example, we'll create two stores - one for the review data and the other for the tweets we collected via the Twitter API.\n",

TinyDB has a notion of [tables](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html?highlight=table#tables) to do this but we must keep in mind that unlike a relational database, we cannot create relationships between tables.  Let's create two tables, one for the Twitter data and one for the review data."
